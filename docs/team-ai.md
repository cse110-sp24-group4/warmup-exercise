# This document will serve as the main form on documentation for Team AI's warmup

## Warmup Goals

- Experiment with the usage of AI to see if it helps productivity.
- Create and practice set processes which we can expand upon for the larger project.
- Develop familiarity with our team members and try to find where specific members' skillsets are best utilized.

## Process

The general team approach will be to create a static webpage based on markups that we drew, then adding functionality in javascript to that after. 

GitHub Issues should be used for everything. **Use the ai-team label.**

Team members will create branches with the prefix **ai-** and then pull requests will be attached to the issues created. 


## AI

Our team goals when using AI are to experiment with AI to see if its usage can improve efficiency, while not compromsing the quality of code written.

### General guidelines for using AI:

 - When copying code from an LLM, be sure to document the prompt that you provided the LLM.
 - Try to make prompts specific. "Make a calendar website in HTML", will likely result in a subpar output. The better the prompt, the better the output will be.
 - Make sure to read and understand all code that the AI wrote. Pushing code without understanding how it works is dangerous and unproductive.
